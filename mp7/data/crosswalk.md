Understanding the risks associated with doing something as reckless as corssing the street without a crosswalk, Steve decides to cross the street at the appropriate location. He reaches the recycling bin safely, and right as he's about to toss away the egg carton of eggs, a little gremlin the size of a small dog jumps at him from seemingly out of nowhere. "Hey Steve! You don't realize it, but you're actions are being written by a lazy computer science student who procrastinated his
assignment! Quick, you gotta get home right now because if you did anything else, then that student would need to write more md files!"

Whatever you say, little gremlin
